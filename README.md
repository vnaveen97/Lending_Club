# Lending_Club

The idea is that some wants an unsecured loan for some purpose (e.g. start a business, have a wedding, ...).  Lending Club takes these loan requests, scores them by various metrics, breaks them up into small chunks, and then connects these chunks with potential retail investors.  These investors will get regular principal + interest payments, but if the loan is defaulted, the investor gets nothing more.

It would be advantageous if we could identify potential loans as likely to pay off or what package of loans might have the best returns.  Or, perhaps something could be learned about the sociodemographics of people and what types of loans they are interested in getting.

Lending Club took the unusual step of making a large amount of their records publicly available.
